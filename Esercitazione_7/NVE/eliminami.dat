Classic Lennard-Jones fluid
Molecular dynamics simulation in NVE ensemble  

Interatomic potential v(r) = 4 * [(1/r)^12 - (1/r)^6]

The program uses Lennard-Jones units 
Number of particles = 108
Density of particles = 1.1
Volume of the simulation box = 98.1818
Edge of the simulation box = 4.61329
Bin size g(r) = 0.0768881
The program integrates Newton equations with the Verlet method 
Time step = 0.005
Number of steps = 1000

Restart form final configuration from file config.final 

Number of time-steps: 100
Number of time-steps: 200
Number of time-steps: 300
Number of time-steps: 400
Number of time-steps: 500
Number of time-steps: 600
Number of time-steps: 700
Number of time-steps: 800
Number of time-steps: 900
Number of time-steps: 1000
Print final configuration to file config.final and scond to last configuration to file config.old_final
